# THE PROJECT
In this GitHub project, the aim is to build and operate a DPV (Dive Propulsion Vehicle) using standard components. In my case, I will breathe new life into an old Aquazepp. The motor I'm using is a common 2000-watt scooter motor, controlled by a VESC (Vedder Electronic Speed Controller). The entire system is controlled through Reed switches activated by magnets with a Bowden cable.

I would greatly appreciate support for my project. Every $ contributes to enhancing the project.

# Development

## IDE 
We currently use the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino IDE</a> for Development. 
Open the file **DPVControl/DPVController/DPVController.ino** to open the project. 

### Board Config
I am using a wroom esp32 board for development. 

Follow this tutorial to install the board https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/

You might need a windows driver: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads


### Download Libraries

Download the .zip files for all the required Libraries (use the github-links in DPVController.ino). Place
them in the /libraries -Folder and install them into Arduino.


# TODO

- 5% - **Web interface:** Retrieve basic information and adjust settings if necessary.
- 0% - **Emergency stop:** Immediately stop in case of sudden increase in current or drop in rotation speed (hand in rotor).
- 0% - **Update via WiFi**
- 0% - **Implement watchdog to make it smooth and stable**
- 30% - **display uptime and overall runtime in gui**
