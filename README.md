# THE PROJECT
In this GitHub project, the aim is to build and operate a DPV (Dive Propulsion Vehicle) using standard components. In my case, I will breathe new life into an old Aquazepp. The motor I'm using is a common 2000-watt scooter motor, controlled by a VESC (Vedder Electronic Speed Controller). The entire system is controlled through Reed switches activated by magnets with a Bowden cable.

# TODO



- **Web interface:** Retrieve basic information and adjust settings if necessary.
- **Battery warning:** Low battery beep. Every 10% rounded down. From 30% remaining.
- **Energy Saver:** 20% - Reduce power to a maximum of 50% starting at X%.
- **Emergency stop:** Immediately stop in case of sudden increase in current or drop in rotation speed (hand in rotor).
- **Update via WiFi**
- **Device must function even in case of water ingress. However, there must be a signal to alert the user.**
- **Light at Level 1 if speed exceeds 80% to prevent battery overload. Light off at 100% power. Then revert to original value.**
- **Implement click codes according to the table**
- **Implement watchdog to make it smooth and stable**
- **display uptime and overall runtime in gui**
